# reorder-neorg
A module to allow for ease of use of reordering lists in Neorg

Specs: 
- A reordering mode, using keymaps to label each list item with a numerical value, using the concealer to overlay the value onto the list item indicator, and a keymap to affirm the order
- Move lists up levels (i.e. if I move reorder a list item in between two higher level list items, it will automatically move up a level)
- move them down levels
- Move them automatically once indicated the position? (maybe, since I would have to find a way to keep the cursor in the same line, say I move list item 6 into position 1 I would have to keep the cursor on position 6)
- insert a list item between two higher level list items without changing the original level
